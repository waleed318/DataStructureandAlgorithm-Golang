# DataStructureandAlgorithm-Golang

This repository is used to store code in my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "Golang".

I'll learn Data Structure and Algorithm with Golang, if you want to see my whole journey Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WaleedA_dev)

Each data structure has its own directory along with a separate README file.
