# Set
A Set is a linear data structure that has a collection of values that are not repeated. A set can
store unique values without any particular order. In the real world, sets can be used to
collect all tags for blog posts and conversation participants in a chat. The data can be of
Boolean, integer, float, characters, and other types. Static sets allow only query operations,
which means operations related to querying the elements. Dynamic and mutable sets allow
for the insertion and deletion of elements. Algebraic operations such as union, intersection,
difference, and subset can be defined on the sets.

Here is an example of how to create and use a set of strings in Go:
