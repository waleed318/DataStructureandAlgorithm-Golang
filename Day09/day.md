# Linked list
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a reference (or "link") to the next element in the list. The elements are commonly called nodes and the reference is usually implemented as a pointer. The first element in the list is called the head and the last element is called the tail. The last element's reference is typically set to nil to indicate the end of the list.

Linked lists are commonly used in computer science because they allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements in the middle of the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list without the need for random access. They do, however, have the disadvantage of requiring more memory than arrays because of the additional pointer stored with each element.

## The AddToHead method
The AddToHead method adds the node to the start of the linked list. The
AddToHead method of the LinkedList class has a parameter integer property. The
property is used to initialize the node.
