# Tuple
In computer science, a tuple is a data structure that consists of a finite ordered list of elements. Tuples are often used to store related pieces of information. Unlike other data types, such as lists and arrays, tuples are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified once they are created. This makes them more efficient for certain operations, and also gives them a fixed size, which can be useful in some situations.
